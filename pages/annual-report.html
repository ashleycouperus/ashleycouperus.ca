      <p class="gutter-2">This annual report provides successful annual report that suits the companyâ€™s needs. There is a consistent minimalistic approach used throughout the report to allow the reader to focus on the written content of the book. No imagery was used in order to portray a childlike appearance, while remaining professional. Lastly, the colours selected were used to provide a warm and comfortable tone. This is an effective choice as Cheo should be perceived as a warm and welcoming place.</p>
