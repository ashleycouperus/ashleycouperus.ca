      <h5 itemprop="name" class="border">Research</h5>
      <p class="gutter-2">This project began by researching Twenty-One Pilots previous album covers. This gave an idea of their particular style and how to approach the design. Spending time researching other musical artist albums in the same music genre, inspired an album design that would stand out against competitors on the shelf.</p>

      <p class="gutter-2">It was fast and easy to come up with quick sketches that would work as a rough guide to set up the photograph. The research guided the designs to stray away from what other people have already done.</p>

      <p class="gutter-2">With the use of colour, photography and a bold design choice, the production of a unique and representative album cover was born. The mix of elements on the cover creates a string of interest and attracts costumers to want to know more. This album cover successfully stands out on the shelf against their competitors.</p>
