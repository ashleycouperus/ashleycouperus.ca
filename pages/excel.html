      <p class="gutter-2">The Excel Woodwork logo reflects the client needs by establishing a logo design that represents Excel Woodwork’s services and values. The combination of the saw and hammer generates a strong contrast between positive and negative space which captures the attention of the target audience. The logo represents the tools and time that Excel Woodwork puts into each and every one of the products they manufacture. Rotation in the saw blade symbolizes Excel Woodwork’s continuous sales and impressive customer satisfaction.
