    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 xl-1-2">The Excel Woodwork logo reflects the client needs by establishing a logo design that represents Excel Woodwork’s services and values. The combination of the saw and hammer generates a strong contrast between positive and negative space which captures the attention of the target audience. The logo represents the tools and time that Excel Woodwork puts into each and every one of the products they manufacture. Rotation in the saw blade symbolizes Excel Woodwork’s continuous sales and impressive customer satisfaction.

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 xl-1-2">After determining the logo design, I began researching and sketching out possible layouts for stationary. By playing with the shape and elements from the logo, I was able to come up with a few solutions.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 xl-1-2">The stationary includes an enveloppe, double sided business card, and letterhead. It was important to ensure all aspects of the stationary worked well together and look cohesive. This was achieved by using the saw blade in both the letterhead and enveloppe. The business card stands out from your average business card by die cutting the imagery of the logo.</p>
